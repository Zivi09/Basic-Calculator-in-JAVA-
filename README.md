# Java GUI Calculator

This is a simple GUI-based calculator built using Java's Swing library. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application has an intuitive and user-friendly interface with clear buttons and a display for easy use 
Note:- i have used netbeans 8.2

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Display**: Large text display aligned to the right for improved readability.
- **User-Friendly Buttons**: Well-spaced buttons for easy interaction, including numbers (0-9), decimal point, operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and an equal sign (`=`) to compute results.
- **Clear Button**: A `C` button to reset the calculator.
- **Resizable Window**: The calculator window is fixed in size to maintain a clean layout.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have the JDK installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **NetBeans IDE**: This project was built using NetBeans IDE. You can download NetBeans from [here](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html).

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-gui-calculator.git
   ```
   Or you can simply download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Open NetBeans** and create a new Java project:
   - File → New Project → Java → Java Application → Next.
   - Name the project `Calculator`.

3. **Add the Code**:
   - In the `src` folder, create a new `JFrame Form` and name it `CalculatorUI`.
   - Replace the automatically generated code in `CalculatorUI.java` with the provided calculator code from this repository.

4. **Run the Project**:
   - After adding the code, right-click on the project in NetBeans and select `Run`. 
   - The calculator window will open, and you can start using the calculator.

## How to Use

- **Input**: Click the buttons on the calculator to input numbers and operators.
- **Perform Calculations**: 
  - After entering a number, click an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), then input the second number.
  - Press `=` to see the result.
- **Clear**: If you need to reset the calculator, press the `C` button to clear the display.
